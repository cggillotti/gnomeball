            <h3>Knuckleball</h3>
            This pitch hasthe most variability in quality. It is usually very difficult to hit, but when contact does happen, it triggers the regular  power roll as well as a special d2 for the batter; this special roll is separate scoring and cannot be prevented by fielding, even if the fielder reduces the regular powerto zero and records an out.Additionally, possessing a knuckleball stunts the growth of the other pitches, with neither being allowed to improve per level.
